I made this code since a LOT of Dungeouns and Dragons one-shots were happening and I wanted to save time rolling for stats.

This was designed with some house rules in mind.
1) The DM can overrule your rolls
2) The DM dictates the maximum and minimum range your average stats should be
3) Usually re-rolling ones. (I made the code adjust the range of acceptable values accordingly)

Overall this is pretty easy to use but you have to go into the x64/Debug folder to find the executable because I used Visual Studio to write, compile, and debug the code.

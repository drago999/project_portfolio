I created this project portfolio to contain the projects I want to show off to potential employers.
This will be added to as I find more to add to it, occasionally I will adjust to improve some of the other projects within here.

I have segregated my projects into seperate folders and have labeled them accordingly.

Hopefully some of this will turn out useful in the long run.

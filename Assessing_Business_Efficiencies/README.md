This project was for my Linear Optimization (Math 464) class.

I used Linear Programming (LP) and Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA) to get relative efficiency scores. 
It was found that most sites scored below 50%, but after applying some guidance that was derived from the scores, all sites ended up scoring above 90% with only three sites below 100%.

This project was exceptionally challenging to me due to the open ended nature of it. However, I enjoyed this project imensely as I experimented, learned, and reasoned how to improve the scores of all the sites and how to create the scoring system.

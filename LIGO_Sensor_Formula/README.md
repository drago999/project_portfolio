This project was for my Principles of Optimization (Math 364) class.

I used Linear Programming (LP) to create an equation to correctly determing positive and negative results.
This was implemented using python and the wonderful libraries that have been made for python.

I quite enjoyed this project and finished it an entire week early since it was quite simple after I understood what I needed to do.

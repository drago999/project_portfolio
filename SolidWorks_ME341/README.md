This project was for my Intermediate Mechanics of Materials (ME 341) at the University of Idaho in early 2020.

Notably this is the only drawing that I rescued from my old computer (the motherboard had corrupted the hard-drive). 
I have the actual solidworks files but I no longer have the program since I am no longer a student and will not display those here.

This drawing happens to be the piece that I spent the longest on due to its difficulty and I gained a reputation of being the "Hole Wizard" and the gratitude of my team members for talking this part instead of them.
